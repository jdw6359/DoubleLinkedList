The implementation of both the TestList and TestSearch methods were 
made relatively simple after the LinkedLists module was complete. Having
a module that is able to manage its resources internally is essential in 
programming. In TestList and TestSearch, it is convenient being able to 
construct the arbitrary MyData node and then simply adding it to the list.

In implementing the search function, there are many ways that it could have
been programmed to take advantage of the doubly linked list. 
Although the function currently starts at the front and "walks" across each 
node until it reaches the end, smarter methods could have been applied
to exploit the fact that it is doubly linked. 

The results of the program are nothing other than expected, and can
